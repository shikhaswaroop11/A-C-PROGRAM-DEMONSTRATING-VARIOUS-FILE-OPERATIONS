##📝 File Handling in C – Internship Task Using OnlineGDB As part of our internship project, we were asked to create a program in the C language that demonstrates basic file handling operations. These include creating a file, writing data to it, reading from it, and appending more data. To implement and test this program, we used OnlineGDB, a web-based compiler and debugger that made it very easy to run and test our code online without installing any software.

💻 Why We Used OnlineGDB OnlineGDB is a free online compiler that supports multiple programming languages like C, C++, Python, Java, and more. What makes it really helpful—especially for students—is that you can run, test, and even debug your code all in one place using just a web browser. It also supports input/output operations and has a built-in terminal, so it's perfect for running C programs that deal with files. We found it fast, beginner-friendly, and reliable for our needs.

📁 What the Program Does Our program is a simple, menu-driven application that allows the user to perform four key file operations:

Create a file – This clears or creates a new file.

Write to the file – This replaces existing content with new text.

Append to the file – This adds new text without removing the existing data.

Read from the file – This displays everything that’s currently saved in the file.

The user can select any of these options through a menu. Each action is handled by a separate function, which keeps the code clean and organized. We used standard C functions like fopen(), fputs(), and fgetc() to perform file operations. Error messages are shown if the file cannot be opened or if anything goes wrong, which helps with debugging.

🌍 Where This Is Useful Although this might seem like a small project, file handling is a core concept used in many real-world applications. Here are a few examples:

Log files – Systems often write logs to files to keep track of events or errors.

Saving settings – Applications store user preferences in files that can be loaded later.

Report generation – Programs can write data to text files or CSVs for future reference.

Data storage – Before using databases, many apps use files to store simple data.

Compilers and interpreters – Read and modify source code files while building.

So, understanding how to read, write, and manage files is a big step towards becoming a better programmer.

🎓 What We Learned This task helped us understand how C handles file input/output, which is essential for creating applications that deal with large amounts of data. It also made us more comfortable working with tools like OnlineGDB, which are really useful for testing code quickly and efficiently. Overall, it was a great hands-on experience that improved both our coding and problem-solving skills.
